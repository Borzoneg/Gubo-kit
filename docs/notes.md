Is it possible to not just identify a crow, but also to identify which crow is which, based on some speciific thing? 
The result could be that the system can try to guess one crow e.g: Tim 50% Ronnie 50% whe the crow turn and we see a particular spot on its right wing
then it's 100% Ronnie. then we update all the previous frame not just of Ronnie but of Tim as well.

We use the combination of the two crows to better estimate the single. Just like us forexclusion can sometime classify something
